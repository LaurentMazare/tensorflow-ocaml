The tensorflow-ocaml project provides some [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) bindings for [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org).

## Installation

Use [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to install the tensorflow-ocaml package.

```bash
opam install tensorflow
```

### Get the TensorFlow Library

The opam package starting from version 0.0.8 requires the version 1.0 of the TensorFlow library to be installed on your system under the name `libtensorflow.so`.
Two possible ways to obtain it are:

* You can build this library from source by following these steps:
    1. [Install the Bazel build system](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html)
    1. Clone the TensorFlow repo.
    
      `git clone --recurse-submodules -b r1.0 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow`
    1. In the `tensorflow` directory run `./configure` (you will be asked if you want to enable CUDA support).
    1. Run `bazel build -c opt tensorflow:libtensorflow.so`.
    1. The resulting library should then be in `bazel-bin/tensorflow/libtensorflow.so`.
* You can download prebuilt binaries from Google:
The releases are available in URLs of the form: `https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-TYPE-OS-ARCH-VERSION.tar.gz`. For example:
    * CPU-only, Linux, x86_64, 1.0.0.
    [https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz)
    * GPU-enabled, Linux, x86_64, 1.0.0.
    [https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-gpu-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-gpu-linux-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz)
    * CPU-only, OS X, x86_64, 1.0.0.
    [https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-cpu-darwin-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-cpu-darwin-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz)
    * GPU-enabled, OS X, x86_64, 1.0.0:
    [https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-gpu-darwin-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/libtensorflow/libtensorflow-gpu-darwin-x86_64-1.0.0.tar.gz)

### Build a Simple Example

Download a [very simple example](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/basics/forty_two.ml) and compile it with the following command:
```bash
ocamlbuild forty_two.native -pkg tensorflow -tag thread
```

Then run it via `./forty_two.native`. You should now be all set up, enjoy!

### Frequent Problems

- When compiling the example with ocamlbuild, I get the following error:
```bash
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltensorflow
```
You should adjust your LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include the directory in which you have added `libtensorflow.so` (and use this exact name). E.g. run:
```bash
LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH ocamlbuild forty_two.native -pkg tensorflow -tag thread
```
- When running forty_two.native, I get the following error:
```bash
./forty_two.native: error while loading shared libraries: libtensorflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
You should adjust your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in the same way LIBRARY_PATH was adjusted in the previous case. E.g. run:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./forty_two.native
```
Note that on OS X, you should adjust your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable

## Examples

Tensorflow-ocaml includes two different APIs to write graphs.

### Using the Graph API

The graph API is very close to the original TensorFlow API.
* Some MNIST based tutorials are available in the [examples directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/mnist).
* `examples/load/load.ml` contains a simple example where the TensorFlow graph is loaded from a file (this graph has been generated by `examples/load.py`).
* `examples/basics` contains some curve fitting examples. You will need gnuplot to be installed via opam to run the gnuplot versions.

### Using the FNN API

The FNN API is a layer based API to easily build neural-networks. A linear classifier could be defined and trained in a couple lines:

```ocaml
  let input, input_id = Fnn.input ~shape:(D1 image_dim) in
  let model =
    Fnn.dense label_count input
    |> Fnn.softmax
    |> Fnn.Model.create Float
  in
  Fnn.Model.fit model
    ~loss:(Fnn.Loss.cross_entropy `mean)
    ~optimizer:(Fnn.Optimizer.gradient_descent ~learning_rate:8.)
    ~epochs
    ~input_id
    ~xs:train_images
    ~ys:train_labels;
```
A complete VGG-19 model can be defined as follows:

```ocaml
let vgg19 () =
  let block iter ~block_idx ~out_channels x =
    List.init iter ~f:Fn.id
    |> List.fold ~init:x ~f:(fun acc idx ->
      Fnn.conv2d () acc
        ~name:(sprintf "conv%d_%d" block_idx (idx+1))
        ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) ~filter:(3, 3) ~strides:(1, 1) ~padding:`same ~out_channels
      |> Fnn.relu)
    |> Fnn.max_pool ~filter:(2, 2) ~strides:(2, 2) ~padding:`same
  in
  let input, input_id = Fnn.input ~shape:(D3 (img_size, img_size, 3)) in
  let model =
    Fnn.reshape input ~shape:(D3 (img_size, img_size, 3))
    |> block 2 ~block_idx:1 ~out_channels:64
    |> block 2 ~block_idx:2 ~out_channels:128
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:3 ~out_channels:256
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:4 ~out_channels:512
    |> block 4 ~block_idx:5 ~out_channels:512
    |> Fnn.flatten
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc6" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 4096
    |> Fnn.relu
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc7" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 4096
    |> Fnn.relu
    |> Fnn.dense ~name:"fc8" ~w_init:(`normal 0.1) 1000
    |> Fnn.softmax
    |> Fnn.Model.create Float
  in
  input_id, model
```
This model is used in the [following example](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/blob/master/examples/fnn/vgg19.ml) to classify any input image, in order to use it you will have to download some [pre-trained weights](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/releases/download/0.0.7/vgg19.cpkt).


There are also some MNIST based [examples](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/tree/master/examples/fnn).

### Character level RNN

A simplified version of [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) can also be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/blob/master/examples/char_rnn) which contains additional details.

### Neural Style Transfer

A stand-alone example of Neural Style transfer can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml/blob/master/examples/neural-style).

## Dependencies

* [ocaml-ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) is used for the C bindings.
* [Base](https://github.com/janestreet/base) is only necessary when generating the graph from OCaml, the wrapper itself does not need it.
* The code in the piqi directory comes from the [Piqi project](http://piqi.org). There is no need to install piqi though.
* [Cmdliner](https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner) is used for command line interfaces.
* [Gnuplot-ocaml](https://bitbucket.org/ogu/gnuplot-ocaml) is an optional dependency used by a couple examples.
